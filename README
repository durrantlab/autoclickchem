== INSTALATION ==

AutoClickChem is a Python script and so requires no compilation. One need only install Python, which can
be obtained from http://www.python.org. Many Linux distributions include Python by default, as does the
latest version of Mac OSX. AutoClickChem can be run thusly:

/path/to/python/binary/python autoclickchem.py {COMMAND-LINE_PARAMETERS}

AutoClickChem has been tested on Linux, Mac OSX, and Windows XP using Python 2.5.2, 2.6.1, and 2.6.5. We
expect the program to work with other Python versions and on other operating systems as well.


== TEST DATA ==

Several example files are included in the ./examples/ directory. “alkyne.pdb” is a PDB file of a molecule 
containing an alkyne chemical group, and “azide.pdb” is a PDB file of a molecule containing an azide 
chemical group. These two chemical groups can react with each other according to the azide-alkyne Huisgen 
cycloaddition reaction, the quintessential click-chemistry reaction. To use these examples files, run
the following from the main AutoClickChem directory:

/path/to/python/binary/python autoclickchem.py -reactants1 ./examples/azide.pdb -reactants2 
    ./examples/alkyne.pdb -output_dir ./output/ -all_reactions +azide_and_alkyne_to_azole

This will create a new directory, ./output/, containing two PDB files corresponding to the two possible
products of the reaction.


== GENERAL TUTORIAL ==

AutoClickChem generates two lists of PDB files, called reactants1 and reactants2. The program tries to
combine the compounds of the first list with the compounds of the second list using the reactions of click
chemistry. To build these two lists, use the tags -reactants1 and -reactants2 from the command line.
Optionally, you can also tell AutoClickChem where to save PDB files of the products using the -output_dir
tag. For example,

python autoclick.py -reactants1 ../azides/myazide.pdb -reactants2 ../alkynes/myalkyne.pdb -output_dir ./output/

The -reactants1 and -reactants2 tags can also specify directories, in which case AutoClickChem will add all
the PDB files in the specified directory to the respective list. For example,

python autoclick.py -reactants1 ../azides/ -reactants2 ../alkynes/ -output_dir ./output/

The program is not limited to one -reactants1 or -reactants2 tag. For example, the following is valid:

python autoclick.py -reactants1 ../azides/myazide.pdb -reactants1 ../azides2/ -reactants2 ../alkynes/myalkyne.pdb
    -reactants2 ../alkynes2/ -output_dir ./output/

Some of the AutoClickChem reactions (e.g., alkene to epoxide) require only one type of reactant, not two. To
access these reactions, use only the reactants1 tag. For example,

python autoclick.py -reactants1 ../alkenes/ -output_dir ./my_epoxides/

Note that, unlike the online version of AutoClickChem, the command-line version only accepts PDB files as input.
We recommend using OpenBabel to convert your small-molecule models from other formats into the PDB format.

If you would like to limit the number of pairs of compounds that are reacted together, the max_reactions tag can
be used:

python autoclick.py -reactants1 ../azides/ -reactants2 ../alkynes/ -output_dir ./output/ -max_reactions 10

The following are special tags that refer to each of the AutoClickChem reactions:

azide_and_alkyne_to_azole
epoxide_alcohol_opening
epoxide_thiol_opening
chloroformate_and_amine_to_carbamate
sulfonyl_azide_and_thio_acid
carboxylate_and_alcohol_to_ester
carboxylate_and_thiol_to_thioester
acyl_halide_and_alcohol_to_ester
acyl_halide_and_thiol_to_thioester
ester_and_alcohol_to_ester
ester_and_thiol_to_thioester
acid_anhydride_and_alcohol_to_ester
acid_anhydride_and_thiol_to_thioester
carboxylate_and_amine_to_amide
acyl_halide_and_amine_to_amide
ester_and_amine_to_amide
acid_anhydride_and_amine_to_amide
isocyanate_and_amine_to_urea
isothiocyanate_and_amine_to_thiourea
isocyanate_and_alcohol_to_carbamate
isothiocyanate_and_alcohol_to_carbamothioate
isocyanate_and_thiol_to_carbamothioate
isothiocyanate_and_thiol_to_carbamodithioate
alkene_to_epoxide
halide_to_cyanide
alcohol_to_cyanide
carboxylate_to_cyanide
acyl_halide_to_cyanide
acid_anhydride_to_cyanide
halide_to_azide
alcohol_to_azide
carboxylate_to_azide
acyl_halide_to_azide
acid_anhydride_to_azide
amine_to_azide
amine_to_isocyanate
amine_to_isothiocyanate
azide_to_amine

By default, AutoClickChem performs all reactions possible. Specific reactions can be turned on or off by 
placing a + or -, respectively, before the appropriate tag. For example, if you want AutoClickChem to avoid
opening epoxides, the following tags can be used:

python autoclick.py -reactants1 ../azides/ -reactants2 ../alkynes/ -output_dir ./output/
     -epoxide_alcohol_opening -epoxide_thiol_opening

The tag "all_reactions" is also valid. If you'd like to perform only the azide_and_alkyne_to_azole reaction,
for example, the following tags can be used:

python autoclick.py -reactants1 ../azides/ -reactants2 ../alkynes/ -output_dir ./output/ -all_reactions
     +azide_and_alkyne_to_azole

I hope you enjoy using AutoClickChem!
