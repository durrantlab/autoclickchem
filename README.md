# AutoClickChem 1.0.0

## NOTES

The AutoClickChem Project, published in 2012
([PMC3305364](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22438795/)), sought to automate in
silico chemical synthesis. To preserve this resource for historical reasons and
accommodate any existing software dependencies, we archive the AutoclickChem
project here.

The software is not actively maintained and is compatible only with Python 2
(not modern Python 3). We generally recommend using more modern solutions (e.g.,
[SMARTS-based reactions via
RDKit](https://www.rdkit.org/docs/RDKit_Book.html#reaction-smarts)).
